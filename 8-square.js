/**
 * Write a script that prints a square

The first argument is the size of the square
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
You must use the character X to print the square
You must use console.log(...) to print all output
You are not allowed to use var
You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)
